Data used in the Sections __3.1__ and __3.2__ of the Paper. 
- __raw__ input data:
  - Retention time data extracted from the PredRet publication by [Stanstrup et al. (2015)][@predret_paper]
  - Accession IDs extracted from [Massbank][@massbank_webpage] for metabolite identification
- __processed__ input data:
  - Cleaned retention times (compare Section __3.1.1__)
  - Molecular fingerprints (compare Section __3.1.1__)
  - MSMS-based scores for the molecular candidates (compare Section __3.2.1__)
- __scripts__:
  - for data pre-processing
  - for fingerprint calculation
